# metalQUIZZ
metalQuizz is a quiz app bulit with JSON and jQuery library which I have chosen over pure JavaScript mainly to speed up the development process and keep the motivation high. During next phases, I am planning to refactor my code or rewrite it entirely using one of JavaScript MVC frameworks. As the app grows in complexity, I would like to start including Sass as well and eventually deploy the final result through Phonegap.
